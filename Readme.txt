Hello,
This project has a few simulataties to Wiki soley because my computer cant create its own django project.
My project is a webiste that help find places to take your kids in December. 
These html pages also come with a google map that shows whereyou can find these places as well as a link to the official webiste
The entries folder contains all my html files and the encyclopedia folder contains my index and layout files as well as my styles.css
While my program does rely heavly on java it also uses Django with its templates folder.
My file is ran like any other. nothing new is needed
